## 🌟 Project Overview

**Eventify Pro** is a full-featured, role-driven web application for end-to-end event management, built with **ASP.NET Core MVC 8**, **Entity Framework Core 8 (Code-First)**, and **SQL Server**. It follows a strict **N-Tier architecture** spanning five projects — `Domain`, `Shared`, `DAL`, `BLL`, `Web` — and was built to handle the real operational complexity of running ticketed events: overselling prevention under concurrent traffic, fraud-resistant gate check-in, multi-gateway payments tuned for the Egyptian market, and email delivery that survives SMTP outages.

The system enables:

- **Organizers** to register, get verified, publish events, define multiple ticket tiers, monitor live sales dashboards, export attendance and reviews to Excel, and request payouts of their revenue.
- **Attendees** to browse events by category, save favorites, book multiple ticket types in a single order, pay via **Stripe** or **Paymob**, and download a QR-secured PDF ticket.
- **Scanners** to validate entry tickets at the venue door in real time through a browser-based QR scanner with instant fraud and duplicate detection.
- **Admins** to govern the entire platform — accounts, organizer approvals, categories, event moderation, payout approvals, audit trails, and system-wide analytics.

> 🎓 Built as a graduation project.

## ✨ Features

### Core Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Event Creation** | Organizers create events with title, description, dates, location, capacity, cover image, and category. Events go through an admin approval workflow before going live. |
| **Ticket Types** | Multiple ticket tiers per event (VIP, Regular, Free) with independent pricing and capacity tracking (`SoldQuantity` vs `TotalQuantity`). |
| **Multi-Ticket Cart** | Attendees book several ticket types in one order via `BookingItems`, issuing fully independent ticket codes from a single checkout. |
| **Overselling Prevention** | Ticket capacity is protected with software-level concurrency control — the second of two simultaneous bookings on the last seat automatically fails. |
| **Payment Integration** | Paymob (cards + e-wallets like Vodafone Cash) for production, with a Dummy gateway for frictionless local development. |
| **QR Code Generation** | Cryptographically secure HMAC-SHA256 signed token embedded in every ticket's QR code. |
| **QR Validation & Fraud Detection** | Real-time camera-based scanning with instant color-coded results: valid, already used, wrong event, or forged/unknown. |
| **PDF Ticket** | Downloadable, printable ticket with the embedded QR code. |
| **Email Notifications** | Booking confirmations, OTP codes, and reminders delivered reliably through the **Outbox Pattern**, immune to temporary SMTP failures. |
| **Identity & Auth** | ASP.NET Core Identity + Google OAuth + email OTP verification, with role-based access (Admin, Organizer, Attendee, Scanner). |
| **Organizer Dashboard** | Real-time sales and revenue charts (Chart.js), plus one-click export of attendee lists and reviews to styled Excel workbooks via **ClosedXML**. |
| **Admin Panel** | Full platform governance — users, organizer approvals, categories, event moderation, payout approvals, audit log review. |
| **Reviews & Ratings** | Post-event ratings (1–5 stars) with admin soft-moderation (`IsHidden`). |
| **Waiting List (FIFO)** | Automatic queue when a ticket type sells out; the first person in line is notified on cancellation and given a time-boxed window to buy. |
| **Cancellations & Refunds** | Attendee self-cancellation with partial/full refund tracking and admin-initiated refunds. |
| **Audit Logging & Archiving** | Every sensitive action is logged with old/new values, IP, and user agent; old logs are migrated nightly to an archive table by a Hangfire job. |
| **Rate Limiting & IP Whitelisting** | Request throttling on sensitive endpoints and IP-restricted access to the admin area. |

### Design Patterns Applied

- ✅ Repository Pattern + Unit of Work
- ✅ N-Tier Architecture
- ✅ SOLID Principles
- ✅ Soft Delete / Soft Moderation (`IsHidden`, `IsActive`, `IsApproved`)
- ✅ Optimistic Concurrency (row-version locking on `TicketTypes`)
- ✅ Transactional Outbox Pattern (`OutboxMessages` + Hangfire processing)
- ✅ Decorator Pattern (`HangfireOutboxServiceDecorator` wraps `IOutboxService` for scheduled execution)
- ✅ Strategy Pattern (interchangeable Paymob / Dummy payment services behind a common interface)
- ✅ Global Query Filters (EF Core) — soft-hidden reviews never leak into public queries
- ✅ Filter-based Authorization (`VerifiedOrganizerFilter`, `AdminIpWhitelistFilter`, `RateLimitAttribute`)
- ✅ Cross-Cutting Audit Logging via Action Filter (`AuditLogAttribute`)

## 🏗 Architecture

The solution follows **N-Tier Clean Architecture** with a strict, unidirectional dependency flow:

```
EventifyPro.Web  ──→  EventifyPro.BLL  ──→  EventifyPro.DAL  ──→  EventifyPro.Domain
                            ↑                     ↑                     ↑
                      EventifyPro.Shared ←─────────────────────────────┘
```

### Dependency Rule

> No layer references a layer above it. `Web` never touches `DAL` directly — every operation goes through a `BLL` service.

### Projects

```
EventifyPro.sln
├── EventifyPro.Domain   → Entities, Enums, Constants            (no dependencies)
├── EventifyPro.Shared   → Result<T>, PagedResult<T>, Helpers, Extensions
├── EventifyPro.DAL      → DbContext, Fluent API Configurations, Repositories, UnitOfWork
├── EventifyPro.BLL      → Services, DTOs, Mapster Registers, FluentValidation Validators
└── EventifyPro.Web      → Controllers, ViewModels, Views, Filters, Background Services
```

## 🗄 Database Design

The schema spans **22 tables**, covering identity, events, ticketing, payments, operations, and auditing.

### Tables Overview

| Table | Description |
|---|---|
| `AspNetUsers` | All users (Identity extended) — Organizer, Attendee, Scanner, Admin |
| `Categories` | Admin-managed event categories |
| `Events` | Core event aggregate — goes through an approval workflow |
| `TicketTypes` | Ticket tiers per event — `SoldQuantity` capped by `TotalQuantity` |
| `Bookings` | One order per attendee — no `TicketTypeId`/`Quantity` directly (see `BookingItems`) |
| `BookingItems` | Line items per booking (`BookingId` + `TicketTypeId` + `Quantity` + `UnitPrice`) |
| `Tickets` | Individual issued tickets, each with a unique signed QR code |
| `Payments` | 1:1 with `Bookings` — Paymob, and Dummy |
| `Refunds` | Refund tracking — supports partial refunds and retries |
| `WaitingLists` | FIFO queue for sold-out ticket types, ordered by `JoinedAt` |
| `ScanLogs` | Append-only audit of every gate scan attempt |
| `Reviews` | Post-event ratings — `IsHidden` enables admin soft-moderation |
| `OutboxMessages` | Transactional outbox for reliable email delivery |
| `AuditLogs` | Live audit trail of create/update/delete actions |
| `ArchivedAuditLogs` | Cold storage for audit records migrated off the hot table |
| `SystemSettings` | Key/value security and policy configuration |
| `SavedEvents` | Junction table — user's favorited events |
| `OrganizerProfiles` | Organizer verification and payout details |
| `EventScanners` | Junction table — which scanner can scan which event |
| `PayoutRequests` | Organizer withdrawal requests against their revenue |
| `Notifications` | In-app notifications |
| `Feedbacks` | Contact / support messages from visitors |

### Key Constraints

```sql
-- Prevents overselling (DB-level)
CHECK SoldQuantity <= TotalQuantity                          ON TicketTypes

-- Ensures exactly one payment per booking
UNIQUE (BookingId)                                            ON Payments

-- QR codes must be globally unique
UNIQUE (QRCode)                                                ON Tickets

-- One review per attendee per event
PRIMARY KEY / UNIQUE (UserId, EventId)                         ON SavedEvents
PRIMARY KEY / UNIQUE (EventId, UserId)                         ON EventScanners

-- One organizer profile per user
UNIQUE (UserId)                                                ON OrganizerProfiles

-- Star ratings must stay in range
CHECK Rating BETWEEN 1 AND 5                                   ON Reviews

-- Monetary sanity checks
CHECK Amount >= 0   ON Payments
CHECK Amount > 0    ON Refunds, PayoutRequests, WaitingLists(QuantityWanted)

-- Waiting-list expiry must come after notification
CHECK ExpiresAt > NotifiedAt                                   ON WaitingLists
```

### Important Design Decisions

- **`ScanLogs` keeps two references to `Events`** — `EventId` (the gate being scanned at) and `ActualEventId` (the ticket's real event) — so a ticket presented at the wrong event is logged precisely instead of just rejected.
- **`SavedEvents` and `EventScanners` use composite primary keys instead of a surrogate `Id`.** They are pure many-to-many links; a numeric identity column would add storage and indexing cost for no benefit.
- **`Payments` enforces a unique `BookingId`.** A booking can only ever have one active payment record — refund and retry history lives in the separate `Refunds` table instead of overloading `Payments`.
- **`AuditLogs` is split from `ArchivedAuditLogs`.** Keeping the live table small means audit-trail queries stay fast even as the platform accumulates years of history; archived rows keep the exact same shape for easy querying later.
- **`WaitingLists` has no `Position` column.** Re-sequencing a position number on every join/leave is a classic race-condition source under concurrent traffic. Priority is instead computed on demand from `JoinedAt`.
- **`OutboxMessages` has no foreign keys.** It is intentionally decoupled from the domain so that a booking, refund, or registration can all queue an email through the exact same resilient pipeline.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8)
- [SQL Server 2022](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads) (or SQL Server Express)
- [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the C# extension
- A Gmail account (for SMTP / OTP emails)
- A [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) project (for Google OAuth)
- Paymob test accounts (optional — Dummy payment works out of the box)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url-here>
cd EventifyPro
dotnet restore
```

### 2. Build the Solution

```bash
dotnet build
```

### 3. Apply Migrations

```bash
dotnet ef database update --project EventifyPro.DAL --startup-project EventifyPro.Web
```

> If `dotnet-ef` isn't installed yet:
> ```bash
> dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef
> ```

### 4. Run the Application

```bash
dotnet run --project EventifyPro.Web
```

Or press **F5** in Visual Studio. The app opens automatically at:

🔗 **`https://localhost:7088`** (or the URL configured in `appsettings.json`)

### Default Admin Credentials

```
Email:    eventifyproitcr4@gmail.com
Password: Eventifypro_itc@1234
```

> ⚠️ Change these credentials immediately before deploying to any non-local environment.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

Open `appsettings.json` inside `EventifyPro.Web` and configure the sections below.

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Database=EventifyProDb;Trusted_Connection=True;TrustServerCertificate=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=True;"
  },
  "BookingSettings": {
    "FlatServiceFee": 50.00
  },
  "EmailSettings": {
    "Host": "smtp.gmail.com",
    "Port": "587",
    "SenderName": "Eventify Pro",
    "SenderEmail": "your-email@gmail.com",
    "Username": "your-email@gmail.com",
    "Password": "your-app-password",
    "EnableSsl": true,
    "SaveLocallyForTesting": false
  },
  "Authentication": {
    "Google": {
      "ClientId": "YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID.apps.googleusercontent.com",
      "ClientSecret": "YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET"
    }
  },
  "AppSecret": "YOUR_HMAC_SHA256_SECRET_KEY_MIN_32_CHARACTERS",
  "BaseUrl": "https://localhost:7088",
  "Paymob": {
    "SecretKey": "egy_sk_test_...",
    "PublicKey": "egy_pk_test_...",
    "HmacSecret": "YOUR_PAYMOB_HMAC_WEBHOOK_SECRET",
    "IntegrationId": "123456",
    "WalletIntegrationId": "654321",
    "IframeId": "7890",
    "BaseUrl": "https://accept.paymob.com",
    "Currency": "EGP"
  }
}
```

> 🔐 **Security note:** never commit real secrets (SMTP password, Paymob/Stripe keys, `AppSecret`) to source control. Use environment variables, User Secrets, or a secrets manager outside local development.

### Google OAuth Setup

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Create a new project and enable the **Google+ API**.
3. Go to **Credentials → OAuth 2.0 Client IDs**.
4. Set the authorized redirect URI to `https://localhost:7088/signin-google`.
5. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** into `appsettings.json`.

### Gmail SMTP Setup

1. Go to your Google Account → **Security → 2-Step Verification** and enable it.
2. Go to **App Passwords** and generate a new app password.
3. Use the generated 16-character password as `EmailSettings:Password`.

### Paymob Setup

1. Create a [Paymob](https://paymob.com) merchant account (Egypt-focused gateway).
2. From the dashboard, collect the **Secret Key**, **Public Key**, the **Card Integration ID**, and the **Wallet Integration ID** (for Vodafone Cash / e-wallets).
3. Configure a webhook pointing to your payment controller and copy the **HMAC secret** used to verify Paymob's callback signatures.

> **Demo Mode:** leave `Method = Dummy` selected at checkout to bypass both gateways entirely during local development and testing.

### Testing Emails Locally Without SMTP

If you don't want to configure a real SMTP account during development:

1. Set `EmailSettings:SaveLocallyForTesting` to `true`.
2. On registration or booking, the system writes an HTML file of the email (ticket or OTP) instead of sending it, inside:
   🔗 `EventifyPro.Web/wwwroot/sent_emails/`
3. Open the generated HTML file in a browser to read the code and test the flow end-to-end.

```

### QR Scan Flow
```
Scanner opens the Web Scan Page → Camera reads the QR token
   → POST to the validation endpoint
      ├── Valid           → Ticket flipped to "Used", logged to ScanLogs   → ✅ Green
      ├── Already Used     → Logged to ScanLogs                            → ⚠️ Amber

```

### Waiting List Flow
```
Ticket Type Sells Out → Attendee Joins WaitingList (QuantityWanted, JoinedAt)
   → Another Attendee Cancels Their Booking
      → WaitingListExpirationProcessor wakes the next person in line
         → They get an email with an ExpiresAt deadline (e.g. 2 hours)
            ├── They book in time     → Status = Converted ✅
            └── They miss the deadline → Status = Expired, next person notified automatically

## 🔑 Key Design Decisions

### 1. Optimistic Concurrency on `TicketTypes`
```csharp
public byte[] RowVersion { get; set; } = [];
// Configured via: Property(x => x.RowVersion).IsRowVersion();
// Two simultaneous bookings racing for the last seat → one throws
// DbUpdateConcurrencyException → BookingService retries or fails the losing request gracefully.
```

### 2. Transactional Outbox + Decorator
```csharp
// EmailService never talks to SMTP directly inside a request.
// OutboxService writes the message row in the SAME transaction as the booking/registration.
// HangfireOutboxServiceDecorator wraps IOutboxService so a recurring Hangfire job
// drains the table every few seconds, retrying up to ErrorCount = 5 before giving up.
```

### 3. `ScanLog` keeps two named navigation properties to `Event`
```csharp
public Event  ScanEvent   { get; set; }  // EventId        — the gate / event being scanned at
public Event? ActualEvent { get; set; }  // ActualEventId  — the ticket's real event (WrongEvent only)
```

### 4. No `Position` column on `WaitingLists`
```sql
-- Position requires re-sequencing every row on every join/leave — a race-condition risk.
-- Queue rank is computed dynamically instead:
SELECT COUNT(*) + 1 FROM WaitingLists
WHERE TicketTypeId = @id AND Status = 'Waiting' AND JoinedAt < @myJoinedAt
```

### 5. `BookingItems` instead of a single `TicketTypeId` on `Booking`
```
Old shape: Booking → one TicketTypeId, one Quantity   (can't mix VIP + Standard in one order)
Current:   Booking → many BookingItems (TicketTypeId, Quantity, UnitPrice)
UnitPrice is snapshotted at purchase time, so a later price change never affects past orders.
```

### 6. `AuditLogs` / `ArchivedAuditLogs` split
```
AuditLogsArchiverJob (Hangfire, daily) moves rows older than N days into ArchivedAuditLogs.
Same column shape, different table — history is preserved without ever slowing down live queries.
```

### 7. Payment Strategy Pattern
```csharp
public interface IPaymentService
{
    Task<Result<PaymentInitResultDto>> InitiateAsync(PaymentInitDto dto);
    Task<Result> HandleWebhookAsync(string payload, string signature);
}
// PaymobPaymentService, and DummyPaymentService all implement
// the same interface, selected at runtime by Payment.Method — the rest of the
// booking flow never branches on which gateway is in use.
```

## 🛡 Security Considerations

- ✅ All passwords hashed by ASP.NET Core Identity
- ✅ QR tokens are signed with HMAC-SHA256 using `AppSecret` — not guessable or forgeable
- ✅ OTP codes are time-limited and single-use
- ✅ `AdminIpWhitelistFilter` restricts the admin area to trusted IP addresses
- ✅ `RateLimitAttribute` throttles sensitive endpoints (login, OTP, checkout)
- ✅ `VerifiedOrganizerFilter` prevents one organizer from editing another organizer's events
- ✅ Global Query Filters keep hidden reviews out of public results by default
- ✅ Full audit trail (`AuditLogAttribute`) captures actor, IP address, and user agent on every sensitive action
- ✅ HTTPS enforced; anti-forgery tokens on all POST forms
- ✅ `IsActive = false` blocks login instantly without deleting user data or history

## 🧪 Seed Data

On first run, the application automatically seeds:

| Seed | Data |
|---|---|
| **Roles** | Admin, Organizer, Attendee, Scanner |
| **Admin User** | `eventifyproitcr4@gmail.com` / `Eventifypro_itc@1234` |
| **Categories** | Technology, Music, Sports, Art, Education, Business, Health, Gaming |

---

## 📊 Performance Notes

| Query | Index Used |
|---|---|
| QR Scan Validation | `IX_Tickets_QRCode` (unique) — O(log n) single seek |
| Browse Events | `IX_Events_Status_StartDate` (composite) |
| My Tickets / My Bookings | `IX_Bookings_UserId_Status` (composite) |
| Scanner Session Log | `IX_ScanLogs_ScannedById_ScannedAt` |
| Waiting List Queue | `IX_WaitingLists_TicketTypeId_Status_JoinedAt` |
| Outbox Processing | `IX_OutboxMessages_ProcessedAt` (filtered, `WHERE ProcessedAt IS NULL`) |
| Audit Archival Sweep | `IX_AuditLogs_CreatedAt` |

## 🧩 Challenges We Faced

- **Preventing overselling under concurrent traffic** — when many users try to grab the last few seats of a popular event simultaneously, naive checks easily allow double-booking. We solved this with EF Core optimistic concurrency (`RowVersion` on `TicketTypes`), so only one of two racing requests can ever win the last seat.
- **Reliable ticket and OTP delivery** — SMTP providers occasionally throttle or fail. The Transactional Outbox Pattern, with the message written in the same DB transaction as the booking and a Hangfire job draining it with retries, meant a temporary email outage never blocked a checkout or lost a ticket.
- **Designing tamper-proof QR tickets** — a plain QR code with a ticket ID would be trivial to forge or duplicate. Signing every QR payload with HMAC-SHA256 lets the scanner cryptographically verify authenticity before a ticket is ever marked as used.
- **Keeping the database fast as audit data grew** — logging every sensitive action is essential for accountability, but an ever-growing `AuditLogs` table slows down queries over time. A scheduled Hangfire job that archives old records into `ArchivedAuditLogs` kept day-to-day performance stable without losing history.
- **Integrating Paymob payment gateway** — Paymob does not provide an official .NET SDK, and its API requires handling different request/response flows, authentication steps, webhook verification, and currency formatting manually. A dedicated payment service abstraction was implemented to encapsulate Paymob integration details and keep the booking flow clean and independent from payment provider logic.
- **Fair, time-boxed waiting list logic** — simply notifying "the next person" wasn't enough; we needed precise queue ordering and an expiring offer window so a non-responsive user doesn't block everyone behind them. A background processor compares `NotifiedAt`/`ExpiresAt` timestamps to automatically roll offers forward.
